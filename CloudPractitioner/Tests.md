# Well-architected framework
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications.

The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:
- Reliability.
- Security.
- Cost optimization.
- Operational excellence.
- Performance efficiency.

## Operational excellence
The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operation, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to delivery business value.
- Perform operations as code
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

## Security
The Security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security.
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events
- Implement a strong identity foundation

## Reliability
The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. 
- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation


## Cost Optimization
The Cost Optimization pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 
- Implement cloud financial management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure


## Performance effiency
The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy

## Sustainability
The discipline of sustainability addresses the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities.
- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
